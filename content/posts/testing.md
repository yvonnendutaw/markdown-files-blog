# **Famous Fibonacci**

There are anumber of ways to implement the fibonacci sequence in python.

I'll however look at three today. 

Using looping technique

	def fib(n):
	 a,b = 1,1
	 for i in range(n-1):
	  a,b = b,a+b
	 return a
	print fib(5)
	
Well I hope you found this helpful .

See you in the next post!
